When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  * Having an online place to back up my code to
  * Sharing the code with others
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  * Review the changes before automatically pulling them down (or pushing)
