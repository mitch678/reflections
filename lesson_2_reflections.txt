What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  * git creates meta about the files in the repo and creates a hidden .git folder to store it
  
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  * The staging area shows you the files you are about to add to a repository.
  * Everything resides within the working directory, but only files that are in the repo are being tracked via commits

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  * If you've changed multiple files, each for a different logical change, you can add one at a time to the staging area and doing a commit for each one

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

  * If you want to test out a new feature, for instance, you could keep that separate from changes to the main project
  
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  * They show the commits before, at the point of and after the branch was created, so you can see how the work diverged
