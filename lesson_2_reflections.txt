What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  * git creates meta about the files in the repo and creates a hidden .git folder to store it
  
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  * The staging area shows you the files you are about to add to a repository.
  * Everything resides within the working directory, but only files that are in the repo are being tracked via commits
